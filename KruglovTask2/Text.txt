The first         generations of IA-32 processors (starting with the Intel 8086 and 8088 processors and going through the Intel 286 and Intel386 processors) did not have an on-chip floating-point unit.Instead   ,    floating-point capability was provided on a separate numeric coprocessor chip   . The first of these numeric coprocessors    was the Intel 8087, which was followed by the Intel 287 and Intel 387 numeric coprocessors.
To allow the 8087 to signal floating-point exceptions to its companion 8086 or 8088, the 8087 has an output pin, INT, which it asserts when an     unmasked floating-point exception occurs. The designers of the 8087 recommended that the output from this pin be routed through a      programmable interrupt controller (PIC) such as the Intel 8259A to the INTR pin of the 8086 or 8088. The accompanying interrupt     vector number could then     be used to access the floating-point exception handler .
However, the original IBM     * PC design and MS-DOS operating system used a different mechanism for handling the INT output from the 8087. It connected the INT pin directly to the NMI input pin of the 8086 or 8088. The NMI interrupt handler then had to determine if the interrupt was caused by a floating - point exception or another NMI event. This mechanism is the origin of what is now called the     "     MS-DOS compatibility mode.     " The decision to use this latter floating-point exception handling mechanism came about because when the IBM PC was first     designed, the 8087 was not available. When the 8087 did become available, other functions had already been assigned to the eight inputs to the PIC     .    One of these functions was a BIOS video interrupt, which was assigned to interrupt number 16 for the 8086 and 8088     .
